# Ubisoft Orbit DLL emulator

This project is an implementation of the Ubisoft Orbit DLL that is required in many old games, such as: 

- Assassin's Creed Brotherhood
- Assassin's Creed Revelations 
- Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Future Soldier

And other Ubisoft titles released in year 2010-2012.

Note that in some cases you also need other uplay emulator, for example `uplay_r1_loader` is required in ACR.
